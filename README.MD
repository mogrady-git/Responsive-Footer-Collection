# Responsive Footer Collection

A collection of projects with a specific focus on HTML and Styling in CSS. Version v1.0.
I often use these Projects as quick-start boiler plates for projects.
Explore the Projects using the Website Portal below.
The Portal page is based on the Overlord Full-Screen Navigation Menu.
